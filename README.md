# Calculator
In my journey to learn JavaScript I built a calculator and styled it to be fun! I'm still a beginner in JavaScript but it has been fun so far.
I have been teaching myself JavaScript and using free online resorces I was able to build this calculator and learn along the way. 
my strengths are deffinitly in CSS but I am all the time tring to learn new languages.
